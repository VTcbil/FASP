The codes are organized in accordance with modules presented in the paper:

1)	Class “FASP_”: 
    The main function and GUI input/output. 
    The output part corresponds to Module 3.

2)	Class “AstrocyteCaMovie”: 
    The class of astrocyte time-lapse Ca2+ imaging data. 
    FASP is a function “fasp()” under this class, meaning to do FASP analysis to an imaging data object.

3)	Class “ActiveMap”: 
    The class of active region map of an imaging data sample, corresponding to Module 1. 
    When an object of “ActiveMap” is generated, procedures in Module 1 are conducted and a map of active regions is reported as output.

4)	Class “ActiveRegion”: 
    The class of the current active region under analysis in Module 2, corresponding to Module 2. 
    The functions belonging to this class serve to find FIUs within the given active region and learn their characteristic curves.

5)	Class “HTregionGrowing”: 
    The class of region growing based on order statistics guided hypothesis testing, corresponding to Section 2.3.3. 
    This class will be used in both Module 1 and Module 2, so we defined it as an independent class.
